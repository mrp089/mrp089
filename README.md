I'm starting my research group as an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Yale University in July 2024. Please have a look at my [lab website](http://biomechanics.yale.edu/) and my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_SNRwoYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I'm looking for prospective PhD students and Postdocs. Contact me at [martin.pfaller@yale.edu](mailto:martin.pfaller@yale.edu).

Currently, I'm an Instructor in Pediatrics - Cardiology at Stanford University in the [group of Alison Marsden](https://cbcl.stanford.edu/) and a developer of the open-source [SimVascular project](https://github.com/SimVascular) for cardiovascular biomechanics.
